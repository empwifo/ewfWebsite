### MSc Econometrics

Econometrics is a four-semester, English-language master’s program of TU Dortmund University (TUDO), Ruhr-University Bochum (RUB) and the University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE). The program is offered jointly by the faculties of economics of the three universities and the Faculty of Statistics @ TU Dortmund University. It combines the expertise and breadth of the participating faculties in empirical economic research and economics with the methodically oriented training of the statisticians and econometricians at Germany’s only Faculty of Statistics. This unique combination of training and research skills allows to offer a specialized curriculum for quantitatively-oriented students which covers a wide range of topics in econometrics and applied economics.

Students acquire the ability to combine methodological competence with proficiency in economics. They gain extensive knowledge of econometric methods and models and an in-depth understanding of central economic causal relationships and resulting econometric issues. The program particularly supports research-interested students in developing analytical skills with regard to specific research questions in economics and thus prepares optimally for a doctorate in econometrics or neighbouring disciplines. The master’s program in Econometrics thus prepares well for a career in econometrics, empirical economic research, and evidence-based policy consulting.

Graduates receive a joint MSc degree from the four participating faculties. Further informations can be found at [econometrics.ruhr](https://www.econometrics.ruhr/).
