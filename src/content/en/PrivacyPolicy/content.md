## Collection of general information when visiting our website.

### Nature and purpose of processing:

When you access our website, i.e., when you do not register or otherwise submit information, information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address and the like.

In particular, they are processed for the following purposes:

* Ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website,
* Ensuring a smooth use of our website,
* evaluating system security and stability, and
* to optimize our website.

We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind will be statistically evaluated anonymously by us, if necessary, in order to optimize our website and the technology behind it.

### Legal basis and legitimate interest:

The processing is carried out pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.

### Recipients:

Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as order processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.

### Storage period:

The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. This is generally the case for data used to provide the website when the respective session has ended.

### Provision prescribed or required:

The provision of the aforementioned personal data is not required by law or contract. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, individual services and services may not be available or may be limited. For this reason, an objection is excluded.

If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
